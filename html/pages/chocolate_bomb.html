    <h1>Chocolate Bomb</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chocolate bomb is a gnome dish that can be made at level 42 Cooking. The premade version is sold in the food shop in the north-west corner of the 2nd floor[US] of the Grand Tree for 160 coins, with 3 in stock. It heals 15 Hitpoints and can be eaten in the same game tick as another food if clicked immediately after the other food (thus if eaten with a shark, you can heal 35 hitpoints with the same delay eating just one shark would produce). Like all gnome foods, they stop burning at level 38 Cooking. This means that Chocolate bombs are never burnt.</p>
