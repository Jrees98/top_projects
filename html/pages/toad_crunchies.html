    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Toad crunchies are a gnome food that can be made with a Cooking level of 10. They heal 8 hitpoints. Toad crunchies may be requested in the Gnome Restaurant minigame. They can also sometimes be received by using the reward token from the minigame. There is also a pre-made version of these, but they cannot be used in the Gnome Restaurant minigame. Toad crunchies are also dropped by tortoises north of the Tree Gnome Village. Like all gnome foods, they stop burning at Cooking level 38.</p>
