Collection of projects made during The Odin Project

1- HTML project:
    For this project I decided to use the gnome restaurant recipies from Oldschool Runescape. This was a game that I played for many years and thought it would be cool to format the website as such.
    
    The one thing that I needed to look up was how to resize an image. That can be done using the "width" and "height" elements inside of the img tag. Other than that, it was a straight forward project that took me roughly 30 minutes to complete.

    Few challenges, but was a good opportunity to refresh the basics.
